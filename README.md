### How to Run Starter Code

#### Make sure you have watchman and node installed.

`brew install node`

`brew install watchman`

#### Installing Xcode

Open the App Store, look for Xcode, and click install. Depending on your internet speed connection, this can take a while because the size of the latest version is 8.1Gb.

#### Installing an iOS Simulator in Xcode

To install a simulator, open Xcode > Preferences… and select the Components tab. Select a simulator with the corresponding version of iOS you wish to use.

#### Install CocoaPods

`sudo gem install cocoapods`

#### Install the dependencies

`npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack`

`npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view`

#### Add the previously installed packages as CocoaPods dependencies

`npx pod-install ios`

#### Run

`npx react-native run-ios`
